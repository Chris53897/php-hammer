    This inspection checks if potentially sensitive parameters are protected by the <code>#[SensitiveParameter]</code> attribute.
    Protecting parameters in this way ensures that in logs or debugging,
    sensitive information such as passwords or bank codes is replaced with a placeholder value.<br/><br/>

    This feature will be available in PHP 8.2+; however, you can safely apply this attribute to older versions,
    with the understanding that the feature won't be available totally, and the value won't be protected.
    This will ensure that a future version migration will already include the feature.<br/><br/>

    You can include or exclude other names in the options, in addition to the default ones.
