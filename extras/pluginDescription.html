<strong>$pluginTitle</strong> is a plugin that adds <a href="https://github.com/hammer-tools/php-hammer/wiki/Inspections"><strong>$inspectionsCount new inspections</strong></a> to the PHP language which are not available in PhpStorm natively, including support for quick-fixes.<br /><br />

You can also try the <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/19645--laravel-hammer/"><strong>ðŸ”¨ Laravel Hammer</strong></a> sister plugin (<strong>important:</strong> this plugin is at a very early stage of development and therefore has very few of the intended features).
